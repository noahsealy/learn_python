None is a singleton, and any variable that stores None is really just a pointer/reference to None
    Its type is NoneType

Is is sometimes better than == when comparing two instances, especially when checking for None.
    This is because is checks not just equality, but also for identity.
    Is will return false if the types are not the same, even if their values are.
    == will return true if the types are not the same, but the values are.
